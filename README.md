jQuery Mobile Portfolio Website Template

Live Demo: http://www.jquery4u.com/demos/mobileportfoliosite/

**Profile Section**

The profile section is pretty basic and can contain personal details you might find on a standard resume such as name, age, location, skills, experience, education etc..

**Portfolio Section**

The portfolio section can be used to show examples of your work as single items or as image galleries.

**Social Section**

The social section is (at the moment) just links to your online web presence mostly social networks. I have further plans to keep users in the mobile site to view as social streams. Weâ€™ll see how this version goes first.

**Contact Section**

The contact page is a basic web form with submission to a PHP script which sends an email.
